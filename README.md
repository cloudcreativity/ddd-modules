# Domain Driven Design Modules

**Write highly encapsulated and loosely coupled modules, for domain-centric architecture.**

## Documentation

This package provides a common PHP toolset for writing these modules.

**It can be tempting to dive straight into the code - you'll need to resist that temptation!**

The key to achieving highly encapsulated and loosely coupled modules is _how you use the tools in this package_. That is
described in the [documentation](https://github.com/cloudcreativity/ddd-modules/wiki) - so ensure you read the docs
before using these tools.

## Installation

```bash
composer require cloudcreativity/ddd-modules

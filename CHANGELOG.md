## Unreleased

### Changed

- BREAKING: The error interface no longer extends `Stringable`. Use `$error->message()` instead, or compose a string
  from multiple properties of the error object.
- BREAKING: The code on an error object is now type-hinted as a `BackedEnum` or `null` - previously it was `mixed`.
  Error codes should be from a defined list, therefore an enum is the correctly defined type.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-11-18

Initial release.
